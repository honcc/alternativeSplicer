alternativeSplicer
==================

This script is mainly built based on geneModelBuilder. This is a perl script to reconstruct the alternatively splicing isoforms of bona fide reference gene models. It will not reconstruct new transcripts outside the reference gene models but instead look for alternative splicing junction WITHIN the bona fide gene models.
